                <span class="Text1">We are at a time when more green spaces can be built in cities that have turned into concrete cemeteries,
                    urban transformation is saved from rent, especially in the modern society in which we live, as can be understood by supporting
                    the increasing importance of environmental awareness every year with certain data, cities that can be humanely lived in should
                    not remain a dream. Environment, caused by different interactions of a whole different perspective, associated with the mutual
                    relations between organisms of the type of interaction we are in terms of the status of parasitism, however, can be understood
                    as mutualism species that need to be reached. In contrast to such situations, especially considering that life continues in
                    a World that is interconnected, in constant interaction with each other by such financial, cultural and environmental solidarity,
                    it is not meaningful that such an anxiety as giving nature the value it deserves has difficulty in perception. However, the general
                    judgment of mankind's environmentally conscious society, the demands of the mind and way of thinking, or directly break the vicious
                    cycles that has more exclusive titles like the people themselves or life that provides the value of the items necessary in order
                    to fully comprehend the situation the realization of the process of signification is required. </span>
              
                <span class="Text2">There are many problems that the production and consumption habits of humanity,
                    which have been increasing since those days, have created and are forming on Earth. Examples of these problems 
                    that are on the agenda today are global warming, air pollution, lost habitats, or emerging epidemics. 
                    The factor that plays the most effective role in the formation of the problems in question is the human 
                    activities that begin to create problems from day to day with the transition to a sedentary life. 
                    The United Nations Environment Programme  has undertaken effective studies on dozens of issues, but
                    perhaps the perception of sustainability on the basis of individuals and society, which should have 
                    been created at the very beginning of the studies, has not been truly formed. Creating this perception
                    is very important because, especially with the increase in the inputs and outputs of ecosystems that 
                    people have created uncontrollably and unconsciously with the industrial revolution, the first seeds of which
                    were laid in 1758, the delicate balances in the ecological system have been disrupted and continue to deteriorate.
                    However, to prevent this situation need to be made in the simplest sense, is planned for the area during the project phase,
                    self-sufficient, sustainable design, sustainable planning and rational that was created from a formation is to provide 
                    permanent solutions compatible with the system. Today, we are at a time when sustainability steps should gain momentum
                    without causing cost concerns. Otherwise, international problems such as local or acid rain, such as soil pollution 
                    caused by excessive interference with life cycles with human activities, will continue to occur. In order to prevent 
                    this situation, if necessary, we should give up luxury in our daily lives and be focused on comfort. </span>
              
                <span class="Text3"> Majority of the people who continue their lives at the moment constitute a pile of ignores 
                    along with dec disadvantages of this economic system that has been created. It is inevitable that 
                    the profit of a civil engineer from the cost of insulation of the building he is building will spread
                    over a large area until a mechanical engineer ignores the decontamination of wastewater from the factory
                    he manages into the ground. The need for waste management, in which the concept of globalization plays an 
                    active role, has increased significantly with the problems of the economy and resources that have arisen due to wars, 
                    and over time it has begun to be considered as a topic that needs to be addressed. Waste management is a form of management
                    that includes three important sub-headings: reduce, reuse and recycle. In contrast to the efforts to correct the
                    situation when internalizing these simple solutions, today mankind has called substances that are harmful to 
                    nature and to itself if they are not managed correctly as 'waste' and behaves as if they are not responsible 
                    for their formation at all. The habit of spending resources as if they will never run out, not knowing how to 
                    use them in a controlled way, in the most general sense, environmental awareness, in a special sense, can be 
                    associated with resource management deficiencies. What has the claim and power to solve this detailed paradox 
                    that humanity has had for many years is waste management practices in which information is fed in a final and dynamic sense.</span>

                <span class="Text4">From the a tradesman using a bad signage, to the fact that a factory destroys natural habitat to generate
                   more income, every result is the work of a lack of environmental awareness in the most general sense. If we consider crowded 
                   places such as Taksim, Mecidiyeköy, where thousands of people pass through per day, most buildings located on the streets are 
                   covered with different signs and allowed to create image pollution. Because, unfortunately, there is no regulation on the 
                   subject that is being applied correctly. Perhaps one of the reasons that distracts Istanbul from the feeling and tranquility
                   of its old streets, and its inhabitants become more tense and fragile, is the pollution of the created image. It can be
                   easily observed that these sensitivities disappear from day to day. Nowadays, while every car is similar to each other,
                   the fact that old model cars can be understood which brand is seen from 100 m away is one of the main examples of the 
                   disappearance of differences. With the globalization that has already taken place, there is a convergence with countries
                   and societies that are constantly becoming uniform, ignoring the local culture. Nowadays, with the disappearance of
                   these differences, the aesthetic understanding that has its own feelings has also become commonplace and has become 
                   the same because awareness has also decreased with the disappearance of differences. In our time, it is a painful fact 
                   that hidden differences in details are lost, and the relationship of this situation with image pollution is that people
                   who have lost their differences forget the value of aesthetic pleasure in life with the loss of their awareness.  </span>

                <span class="Text5">Although it sounds like a rhetorical expression, man is essentially one of the parts of nature and has 
                  responsibilities that he is obliged to fulfill together with the internality that comes with being in the system. When 
                  life itself is looked at from a slightly different, partly philosophical point of view, rather than living its responsibilities
                  by heart, it becomes possible for a person to realize the value of nature, to feel and understand integrity completely. 
                  In order to perceive the full value of some things, such as the theory of knowledge, which is looking for answers to questions 
                  such as the possibility and impossibility of knowledge, in other words, an approach created using epistemology, knowing
                  the concept itself, it is necessary to be present in the concept, to feel it. The fact that it is possible to carry out 
                  the thinking process by feeding on the relationship of philosophy and the environment is only possible with the mentioned 
                  communication, so it is quite an important and valuable nuance to be able to incorporate this into their inner awareness 
                  while becoming a whole with nature. As a result of the output of such abstract concepts, the concept of unification with
                  the stillness and movement of nature arises, which is also caused by the desire of man to connect with living beings by 
                  nature. This thesis can also be supported by the fact that most practices of relaxing the mind, forms of meditation involve
                  harmony with nature, unification... </span>
